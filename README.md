This application crawls the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain and indexes SLP token transactions. This code base is intended to be a replacement for [SLPDB](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/docker-slpdb). The work is based on [this report](https://gist.github.com/christroutner/77c46f1fa9adaf593074d41a508a6401) and the work was funded by [this Flipstarter](https://flipstarter.fullstack.cash/).

This indexer is one part of a collection of blockchain infrastructure. To understand how all the pieces fit together, read the [Cash Stack Documentation](https://cashstack.info).

If you have question or need help, ask in the [community support Telegram channel](https://t.me/psf_slp).

## Installation and Usage

This software is intended to be run inside a Docker container, controlled with Docker Compose, on a Ubuntu 20 OS.

- Enter the `production/docker` directory.
- Build the image with `docker-compose build --no-cache`
- Ensure you have a BCHN full node running and fully synced.
- Start the indexer with `docker-compose up -d`

## Development Status

Current status: **Beta**

This project is using conventional development milestones:
- Alpha = Under active development. Bugs are expected, things are expected to break.
- Beta = Some bugs still exist, but code is mature enough for careful roll-out into production.
- Production = Code has been heavily tested and code commits have slowed in frequency. App is ready for normal operators.

Regular status updates will be reported at the [bi-weekly PSF Technical Steering Committee meetings](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/TSC/issues). Updates will also be reported in [this Telegram channel](https://t.me/psf_slp).
